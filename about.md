Jaromír Janisch finished his Master studies as a Software Engineer at University of West Bohemia in 2012. Until 2016 he worked in several software companies, mainly as a developer. He’s been always passionate about progress in artificial intelligence and decided to join the field as a researcher. In April 2017, he joined the [AIC](http://aic.fel.cvut.cz/) group at [ČVUT](https://www.fel.cvut.cz/en/) in Prague and is working on his Ph.D. there.

In this blog he strives to extract main points from sometimes complicated scientific research, reformulate them in his own words and make it more accessible for people outside the field.
